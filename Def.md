## Java Persistence Query Language
The Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) is a platform-independent object-oriented query language defined as part of the Java Persistence API (JPA) specification.  
JPQL is used to make queries against entities stored in a relational database. It is heavily inspired by SQL, and its queries resemble SQL queries in syntax, but operate against JPA entity objects rather than directly with database tables.  
JPQL is based on the Hibernate Query Language (HQL), an earlier non-standard query language included in the Hibernate object-relational mapping library. Hibernate and the HQL were created before the JPA specification. As of Hibernate 3 JPQL is a subset of HQL.

## Java Persistence API
The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java application programming interface specification that describes the management of relational data in applications using Java Platform, Standard Edition and Java Platform, Enterprise Edition.
Persistence in this context covers three areas:
..*the API itself, defined in the javax.persistence package
    the Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL)
    object/relational metadata
